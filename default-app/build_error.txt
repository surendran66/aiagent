Build and code generation could not proceed due to persistent tool invocation/output issues. The attempted code and project-generation commands (mvn archetype:generate, custom code and pom.xml bootstraps) failed with 'Wrong output type returned' and did not yield compilation, project scaffolding, nor Maven metadata validation. This is a constraint of the current automated environment and not in the application design or provided instructions. Please ensure the code tool integration with Maven is functioning, and retry.
